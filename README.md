### About LinkAce

![Preview Screenshot](https://www.linkace.org/images/preview/linkace_dashboard.png)

LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect links of your favorite websites. Save articles to read them later, tools to use them in your next project, or historic content to archive it for the long term. LinkAce comes with a lot of features while keeping a clean and minimal interface.  
It wasn't built to manage the bookmarks of your browser but has its very own philosophy. My browser bookmarks contain only websites I regularly use and access. LinkAce, in contrast, is meant to provide a _long-term_ archive of links to websites, media files or anything else which has a valid URL.

#### Feature Highlights

* Save links with automatic title and description generation.
* Automated link monitoring informs you when any links become unavailable or were moved.
* Automated backups of saved sites via the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/).
* Organize bookmarks with the help of lists and tags.
* A full REST API offers access to all features of LinkAce from other apps and services.
* LinkAce ships with a light and dark theme, that can be toggled or changes automatically.
* A bookmarklet to quickly save links from any browser.
* Links can be private or public, so friends or internet strangers may see your collection.
* Both private and public links are accessible via RSS feeds.
* Add notes to links to add thoughts or other relevant information.
* An advanced search including different filters and ordering.
* Import and export of bookmarks from HTML.
* Support for complete database and application backups to any AWS S3 storage.

More features are already planned. Take a look at the [project board](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/projects/1) for more information.

#### Documentation and Community

Any further information about all the available features and how to install the app, can be found on the [LinkAce Website](https://www.linkace.org/). Additionally, you may visit the [community forums](https://community.linkace.org/) to share your ideas, talk with other users or find help for specific problems.

### :bulb: Support for LinkAce

I built LinkAce to solve my own problem, and I now offer my solution and code without charging anything. I spent a lot of my free time building this application already, so I won't offer any *free* personal support, customization or installation help. If you need help please visit the [community forum](https://community.linkace.org/) and post your issue there.

You can get personal and dedicated support by **becoming a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Kovah)** or **[Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Kovah)**. :star:
